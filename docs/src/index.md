# FractionalTransforms.jl

Hello thereðŸ‘‹!

FractionalTransforms.jl is a Julia package aiming at providing supports for computing fractional transforms.

## Installation

To install FractionalTransforms.jl, please open Julia REPL and press`]` key to use package mode and then type the following command:

```julia
Pkg> add FractionalTransforms
```

Or if you want to experience the latest version of FractionalTransforms.jl:

```julia
Pkg> add FractionalTransforms#master
```

## Plans

* Add more examples relating to signal processing, image processing etc.
* Cover more algorithms, including Fractional Hadamard Transform...

## Acknowledgements

I would like to express gratitude to

**FractionalTransforms.jl** is built upon the hard work of many scientific researchers, I sincerely appreciate what they have done to help the development of science and technology.

!!! info "WIP"
		FractionalTransforms.jl is under heavy construction, some API or docs might change a lot.
